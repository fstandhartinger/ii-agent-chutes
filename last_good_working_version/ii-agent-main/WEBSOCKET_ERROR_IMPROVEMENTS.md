# WebSocket Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to WebSocket error handling and logging to provide better diagnostics and user experience.

## Backend Improvements (ws_server.py)

### Enhanced Logging
- **Connection Tracking**: Each WebSocket connection now has a unique ID and client IP tracking
- **Detailed Error Messages**: All errors include connection ID, client IP, and context
- **Connection State Monitoring**: Active connection count is logged with each event
- **Query Logging**: User queries are logged (first 100 characters) for debugging

### Structured Error Responses
All error responses now include:
```json
{
  "message": "Technical error message",
  "error_code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE", 
  "user_friendly": "Human-readable explanation with actionable advice"
}
```

### Error Codes Added
- `QUERY_IN_PROGRESS`: When user tries to send multiple queries simultaneously
- `WORKSPACE_NOT_INITIALIZED`: When workspace setup fails
- `UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_TYPE`: When invalid message format is received
- `INVALID_JSON`: When JSON parsing fails
- `PROCESSING_ERROR`: When general processing errors occur
- `NO_ACTIVE_QUERY`: When trying to cancel non-existent query

### Connection Management
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 50 concurrent connections to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Timeout Handling**: 5-minute timeout for inactive connections
- **Graceful Rejection**: Server overload returns code 1013 with clear reason
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of stale connections every minute

## Frontend Improvements (home.tsx)

### Enhanced Error Handling Function
New `handleWebSocketError()` function provides:
- **Detailed Console Logging**: Complete debugging information in browser console
- **Context-Aware Messages**: Different user messages based on error type
- **User-Friendly Guidance**: Clear instructions on what users should do
- **Automatic Suggestions**: Helpful tips appear after errors

### Improved Error Messages
Instead of technical "WebSocket connection is not open", users now see:
- "Connection not ready. This might be due to high server load with many users. Please refresh the page and try again."
- Follow-up tip: "If the problem persists, the server might be experiencing high traffic. Please try again in a moment."

### Console Debugging
Enhanced console output includes:
- WebSocket ready state with human-readable meanings
- Connection attempt tracking
- Server response details
- Current application state
- Model and configuration information

### Error Response Processing
The frontend now processes enhanced error responses from the backend:
- Uses `user_friendly` message when available
- Falls back to technical message if needed
- Logs all error details to console for debugging
- Provides error codes for programmatic handling

## WebSocket Monitor Utility (websocket-monitor.ts)

New utility class for connection health monitoring:
- **Health Information**: Complete connection state tracking
- **Ready State Translation**: Human-readable WebSocket states
- **Close Code Translation**: Meaningful close reason descriptions
- **Connection History**: Tracks connection attempts and timing
- **Debug Logging**: Structured health information logging

## Usage Examples

### Backend Error Response
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "content": {
    "message": "A query is already being processed",
    "error_code": "QUERY_IN_PROGRESS", 
    "user_friendly": "Please wait for the current request to complete before sending a new one."
  }
}
```

### Frontend Console Output
```
üîç WebSocket State Details
Socket exists: true
Is connected flag: false
Socket ready state: 3
WebSocket.OPEN constant: 1
Ready state meanings: {0: "CONNECTING", 1: "OPEN", 2: "CLOSING", 3: "CLOSED"}
```

### User Experience
- **Before**: "WebSocket connection is not open. Please try again."
- **After**: "Connection not ready. This might be due to high server load with many users. Please refresh the page and try again."
- **Follow-up**: "üí° If the problem persists, the server might be experiencing high traffic. Please try again in a moment."

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Developers can quickly identify connection issues
2. **Improved UX**: Users get helpful, actionable error messages
3. **Proactive Monitoring**: Connection health is continuously tracked
4. **Server Protection**: Connection limits prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Clear Communication**: Users understand when issues are due to high load

## Monitoring Commands

To monitor server health in production:
```bash
# Run the diagnostic script
python diagnose_server.py

# Check WebSocket connections
grep "WebSocket" /var/data/agent_logs.txt | tail -20

# Monitor connection patterns
grep "Active connections" /var/data/agent_logs.txt | tail -10
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automatic Reconnection**: Implement smart reconnection with exponential backoff
2. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize connection management for high load
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard for connection health metrics
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute connections across multiple server instances
